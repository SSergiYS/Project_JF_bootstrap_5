But it earned worldwide recognition long before that. Its uniqueness, the reason for its high popularity, is based on simple but effective rules:</p>
                    <ul class="list-group list-group-flush ">
                        <li class="list-group-item fs-6 text-start">Maximum variety of ingredients and their freshness.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item fs-6 text-start">The desire not to compete with nature by creating new incredible flavors, but on the contrary, to find a balance of ingredients that would emphasize the natural nuances of each product.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item fs-6 text-start">Respecting the seasonality of dishes.</li>
                        <li class="list-group-item fs-6 text-start">A healthy and balanced diet according to the principle of ichiju-sansai. It implies that the main meal should include one soup, three kinds of snacks made of protein foods and vegetables, and rice.</li>

                <p class="fs-5">The cuisine of the Land of the Rising Sun is simple yet remarkably harmonious, exquisite, delicious, and infinitely varied. Its basic principles were formed in the medieval Heian period and are still observed today.</p>
                <p class="fs-5">Food in Japan must correspond to the five tastes of gomi: sweet, salty, spicy, sour, and bitter. But there is a sixth, special flavor that the country's cooks know how to reveal masterfully — umami. It is characteristic of many protein products and broths based on them.</p>
                <p class="fs-5">The meal must delight all the senses for it to be truly satisfying. That is why the beauty and aesthetics of the design and serving of dishes are highly valued. The principle of seasonality is observed not only in the choice of products for cooking but also in serving. 
                Shape, decor, and colors of tableware are thought over very carefully. It should correspond to the current time of year and harmonize with the ingredients of the served dishes. The five basic colors — white, black, yellow, red, and green — must be on the table in different combinations. 
                And the special table etiquette, which implies the use of hashi sticks, turns any meal into a kind of theatrical performance.</p>
                <p class="fs-5">This simple, at first glance, philosophy has raised the gastronomic traditions of Japan to a whole new level. Today, this country's cuisine is the world's heritage and is a source of inspiration for the best cooks on the planet. Getting to know it is one of the best reasons to visit the Land of the Rising Sun.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Many foreigners who order this dish in Japanese restaurants expect to receive beautifully decorated slices of fish. In fact, the term sashimi refers to any thinly sliced raw food. In addition to fish and seafood, it can be beef (gyusashi), deer meat (shikasashi), chicken (torisashi), and horse meat (basashi). A classic serving of this Japanese food involves eating it with wasabi, ginger, daikon, and perilla (shiso) leaves. A set with shikasashi includes citrus fruits, which bring out the flavor of deer meat more fully. They add green onions when serving basashi.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">The second name for this popular Japanese breakfast or snack is omusubi. It is rice balls with a variety of fillings, from vegetables to meat and seafood. In Tokyo, for example, onigiri with pickled umeboshi plums, which have a specific sour-salty taste, are popular. They can also be triangular in shape and wrapped in nori. Unlike sushi, which requires special skills and men's hands, girls make onigiri. This dish is inexpensive and so popular that you can buy it literally everywhere, from supermarkets to vending machines.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Another iconic meal is fresh shrimp, fish, and vegetables deep-fried in a tender, crispy batter of egg, ice water, and flour whipped into air bubbles. Once it gets into the boiling oil, it blooms like a flower (hana in Japanese). Therefore, this method of cooking is called hana age. The tempura is accompanied by a special sauce called tentsuyu. This is a broth made from kombu seaweed or dried mackerel, very sweet rice wine mirin, and soy sauce.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Chicken skewers on bamboo skewers baked on coals are among the most favorite Japanese snacks to go with alcohol. Chefs use all parts of the bird — breast, thigh, skin, liver, heart, and cartilage. Each type of meat is served on a separate skewer. Before cooking, it is marinated in a mixture of rice wine, soy sauce, sugar, and salt and served with tare sauce. In addition to chicken, other types of meat and vegetables may be used. Shiitake mushrooms and enoki mushrooms wrapped in bacon with green onions and shishito peppers are a delicious option.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">In fact, it is a hot soup of fresh wheat noodles in a fragrant broth with various additives. What ingredients one finds in their ramen depends on the region, city, and particular restaurant. There are many variants of this dish and the author's recipes. You should definitely try the noodles with Chashu pork, bamboo shoots Menma, tsukemono pickles, pickled shiitake mushrooms, mung bean sprouts, fresh spinach, green onions, and boiled or fried egg. When it comes to ramen broth, there are four main varieties.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">These are hearty wheat noodles, 2 to 4 mm in diameter, which, unlike ramen, have no eggs in their components. The noodles become soft and elastic when boiled. They eat them both cold and hot. Sometimes udon is used as a side dish to meat and vegetables. But more often, udon is poured with dashi broth, seasoned with rice wine, green onions, and soy sauce. Chicken, shrimp tempura, and tofu are added when serving.</p>

Soba retains a nice dense consistency when boiled. In summer, it is usually eaten cold and dipped in tsuyu sauce. It is made from dashi broth (kombu seaweed decoction infused with bonito tuna flakes), soy sauce, mirin, and sake. During the cold season, soba is often eaten as noodle soup with hot broth.</p>

The dough consists of grated cabbage, flour, eggs, and a small amount of dashi broth. In the classic version of the preparation, the flatbread is well soaked in a special sauce and sprinkled with dried tuna flakes or chopped aonori seaweed. Any ingredient — pork, seafood, beef, or vegetables — may be chosen as an accompaniment. Cooking techniques and types of toppings vary from city to city. </p>

One of the most popular ways to cook it is in the kabayaki style. The fish is coated in a sweet tare sauce and caramelized over charcoal. If the cooked eel is served on a bed of steamed white rice, the dish is called una don. Fried or smoked unagi can be a component of sushi and miso soup. Unlike other fish, it is never eaten raw.</p>

But the Japanese themselves, when ordering karaage, most often mean chicken chopped in small pieces and fried to a nice crisp. This is one of the most popular beer snacks offered in many izakayas. However, fans of seafood and fish should definitely try them as well. The finished karaage is served with a slice of lemon and dipping sauce.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">One of the most expensive delicacies of Japanese cuisine that you must try is the Wagyu marbled beef steak or its elite Kobe variety. The best way to enjoy this flavorful and melt-in-your-mouth meat is to visit a designated restaurant where it is cooked on a grill or a teppan pan. Chefs use a minimum of spices and salt to avoid ruining the flavor of the beef. It is better to choose a mild or medium cooking degree, so the marbled fat reaches the desired melting point. Seasonal vegetables are served as a side dish.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">It is not just a dish, but a whole culinary act, where the guest of the restaurant takes an active part. They put a stove in front of them, on which a special kettle with boiling broth is placed. The ingredients are lowered into the pot for a very short time. When boiling, they pop up with a characteristic sound, due to which the dish got its name. It is up to the customer to choose the ingredients for shabu-shabu. Most often, it is thinly sliced beef, but you can also try pork, chicken, duck, crab meat, or lobster. You can also choose tofu, vegetables, and mushrooms, which do not need to be cooked for a long time. They serve two kinds of sauces — goma (based on sesame paste) and ponzu, which includes citrus juice, myrrh, and dashi. They put noodles or rice in the broth left over after cooking and finish the meal with it.</p>

They are fried in cafes and street stalls using a special pan with hemispherical indentations. The finished dish is covered with aromatic takoyaki sauce and Japanese tamago-no-mono mayonnaise and topped with a sprinkling of aonori seaweed and tuna flakes. The appetizer should definitely be eaten hot, as its texture becomes coarser as it cools.</p>

Depending on how they are cooked, they include yaki gyoza (fried in a little oil and water), age gyoza(deep-fried), sui gyoza (boiled), and mushi-gyoza (steamed). Gourmets should definitely try ebi gyoza stuffed with chopped shrimp and rice. The dish is served with a flavorful mixture of soy sauce, rice vinegar, and spicy oil.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">One of the most controversial Japanese meals, as even the people themselves are divided into two camps: connoisseurs and haters. Natto is fermented soybeans that are eaten together with rice, green onions, and raw eggs seasoned with soy sauce and karashi mustard. They have a peculiar smell with pronounced notes of ammonia, a sweet and salty taste, and a sticky, gooey consistency that many may find unpleasant. Natto is most often served for breakfast. The beans should be stirred well before eating. The dish is prized not primarily for its taste but also for its medicinal properties, which have been proven in several studies.</p>
